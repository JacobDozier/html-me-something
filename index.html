            <p>
                My wife and I decided that we wanted to leave the country for our honeymoon.
                We saved up for a long time, on top of the already expensive wedding planning.
                This is the story, highlights really, of our honeymoon and why we loved it so much
                that we decided to go back.

                    <h2>Crown Paradise Golden, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, MEX</h2>
                    <p>
                        Puerto Vallarta is a tourist city nestled next to Bahia de Banderas and 
                        this was among the first things we saw. The resort was on of the older
                        ones in the city, being the second in the row once in the city proper.
                        It was like something out of a movie. We set our bags down to sign in
                        and we turned around to a bell boy holding out fruity drinks for us.
                        When we took the drinks, he took our bags and off we went.

                    <h2>Cookin Vallarta</h2>
                    <p>
                        You know how they say, "Save the best for last"? We didn't do that on
                        this trip. We decided to take a cooking class while in Mexico, so that
                        we would have the ability to recreate at least some part of our trip.
                        This cooking class was easily the best part of the trip. Chef 
                        Enrique brought us to the local market where we picked fresh 
                        ingredients and sampled hand made tamales. Then, he brought us back 
                        to his home to cook with his wife and sister. We cooked, we laughed, 
                        and we drank tequila. Best food I've ever had, with some of the
                        nicest people I've ever met. If you ever go to Puerto Vallarta and
                        want a cultural experience: take the Cookin Vallarta food tour with
                        Chef Enrique, seriously.

                        This was the first moment in during our honeymoon where we got to
                        just sit back and take in the fact that we were husband and wife.
                        We spent the rest of this day playing in the ocean, eating, drinking, 
                        and sleeping. Not much to say here other than this was Brittany's 
                        first, and my second, time swimming in the Ocean. Although, it was a 
                        first for both of us to swim in the <em>Pacific</em> Ocean.

                    <h2>Beach Party</h2>
                    <p>
                        Perhaps "Beach Party" is a bit of an exageration, but as you can
                        see we had fun. Funny story, haggling is alive and well in Mexico.
                        Lico, the guy in the white shirt, noticed us walking on the 
                        beach and asked us if we wanted to go parasailing. I replied with,
                        "Who wouldn't," and he brought us to his umbrella to negotiate.
                        He proposed a price per person and I turned to Brittany to
                        discuss it. I didn't want to spend all of the dollars we had left,
                        we exchanged most of our cash for pesos. Lico heard this and said
                        to forget the price. For the same price, he offered the 
                        parasailing and a ziplining tour in the Sierra Madres to the 
                        southeast of Puerto Vallarta. The funny part was that I wasn't 
                        even trying to haggle.

                    <h2>Room With A View</h2>
                    <p>
                        After a long day of playing on the beach we wanted to relax.
                        There was a problem however, our room's air conditioner was 
                        broken. I had gotten to 32 degrees Celcius in our room and we 
                        were not having it. The maintenance tech trying to fix it 
                        learned that we were on our honeymoon and exlaimed, "You are 
                        on your honeymoon?!? Why aren't you in a suite?!?" We explained 
                        that we asked if we could upgrade but that the concierge said 
                        that they were all full. This was apparently not the case as 
                        the maintenance tech could not fix the room's A/C and we were 
                        upgraded to a suite for free. We saw him as we were "carrying" 
                        our bags to the new room and he quietly exlaimed, "I did it!!!"
                        as we walked by, beaming ear to ear.

                        This was the saddest part of the trip, leaving. We were honestly
                        hoping that the hurricane, a hundred miles east, would ground all 
                        of the planes and we would be forced to stay.

                        shoddy selfie does not due it justice.

                        After settling in our room and eating we walked the beach reminiscing
                        about our last visit. I decided to take a picture of Bahia de 
                        Banderas, which we learned was one of the largest naturally occuring 
                        bays in the world. On the right and left you can see the mountains in 
                        the distance that enclose the bay. There is also an island in the bay 
                        that you cannot see, that is how big it is.

                    <p>
                        It just so happened that there was a vendor on the grounds of the 
                        resort that offered clay skulls that you could paint. Everyone has 
                        heard of Dia de los Muertos, "The Day of the Dead," and it is very 
                        important in Mexico. The vendor adds some more traditional 
                        decorations and takes it for the night to be fired in a kiln. You 
                        come back the next day and you have a beautiful souvenir that has 
                        significant culture meaning. It also doubles as an awesome 
                        halloween decoration (Dia de los Muertos != Halloween).
